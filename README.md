COMP 472 (Artificial Intelligence) - Assignment 1\
Francis Truong - 40087705

1 - Open "Assignment-1.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook.\
2 - Click "Run" to run all cells, or CTRL+Enter to run individual cells in order.\
\
New datasets must be added manually.\
\
The program will take as input 2 datasets, prepare them for testing, and plot their distribution.\
There will be 6 different Machine Learning models for each set of data. The output will indicate how well it performed.\
An output file for each test and dataset will be produced for additional results and details.\
\
The 6 Machine Learning models performed are the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, baseline Decision Tree, optimized Decision Tree, Perceptron, baseline Multi-Layered Perceptron, and optimized Multi-Layered Perceptron.
