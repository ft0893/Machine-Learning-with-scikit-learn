New datasets must be added manually.\
\
The program will take as input 2 datasets, prepare them for testing, and plot their distribution.\
There will be 6 different Machine Learning models for each set of data. The output will indicate how well it performed.\
An output file for each test and dataset will be produced for additional results and details.
